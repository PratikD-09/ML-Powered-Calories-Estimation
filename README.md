# Calorie Estimation Model ðŸ”¬ðŸ¤–  

A machine learning model designed to predict calorie expenditure based on physiological input features such as heart rate, age, and more. The project explores the potential of machine learning in fitness tracking and healthcare solutions.  

## Features  
- Predicts calorie expenditure using physiological data.  
- Implements and compares **Linear Regression** and **XGBoost** algorithms.  
- XGBoost achieves superior accuracy due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships.  
- Performance evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calorie-estimation-model.git
